 * Specifying multiple ID names for --in-port/--out-port options in 
   ControllerBridge is now supported.

   rotation value by editing VRML file.

 * Embeded OpenRTM-aist-0.4.2 installer in to Ubuntu installer script and 
   removed unnecessary packages.[Linux edition]

 * The Trouble that the identification name was not able to be used by 
   specifying the input port of ControllerBridge, was corrected.

 * When orientation of the robot's base coordinates system and the angles 
   of all joints were given in the NoSim mode (the mode when Forward Dynamics 
   is deselected) and the simulation started, the issue of displaying as 
   it moves only the base link preceded, was resolved.

 * Resolved the problem of which the OK/CANCEL button was not displayed, 
   when GrxUI's OpenHRP Tab-window-size was too narrow.

 * Fixed the issue of that unbale to simulate SampleController, When it was 
   executed with "Tokyo University's server" (DynamicsSimulator/server.ut).

 * The problem that the image generation of ViewSimulator was not going 
   corresponding to the simulation time, was corrected.

 * The error occured when DynamicsSimulator was started in debug mode of 
   VC++, was resolved.[Windows edition]

 * Fixed the trouble which was unable to refer jython.jar, since the jython 
   distributors changed the installing location of jython.jar . [Linux edition]

 * The definitions in config.sh and config.bat were changed to include only
